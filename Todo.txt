Version 1.1 Update
New Platform textures
Credits scene effect was fixed
Levels are now procedurally generated meaning no two levels are the same and change everytime a new game is started
Level generation now uses high-entropy seeds each run; world 10 tower levels are longer
New portal collapse finale cutscene after killing the world 10 boss and new boot intro cutscene before world 1-1
Dev console and level editor removed (I might make a brand new Level Editor in the future)
