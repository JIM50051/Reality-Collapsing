Version 1.1 Update
New Platform textures
Controller support was added
Credits scene effect was fixed
New character customization screen was added
Cosmetic and player skills shop was added and now there is a use for coins
Dev console and level editor removed (I might make a brand new Level Editor in the future)
Updated boss fights adding shield and big blast (hold down shoot button and release without shield active)
New portal collapse finale cutscene after killing the world 10 boss and new boot intro cutscene before world 1-1
Levels are now procedurally generated meaning no two levels are the same and change everytime a new game is started
